# CS320 Reflection

The goal in this class was to learn about software testing and automation.
Using the approaches we've I've learned here I can approach software development, design and quality assurance with a quality in mind.

When presented with requirements one can beging breaking those requirements down into smaller or bit size bits of requirements.  These functionaly decomposed requirements can then be written as unit tests.  After building software that passes test, one can be reasonably certain that the software is functionally correct.  

To ensure secure and reasonably correct implementation of specifications static testing approaches can be used.  For secure coding practices, static code analysis tools can be used befor code is ever submitted for testing.  Further, code reviews for every code commit can be used as an additional way to verify code security and compliance to standards.
